            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
                The Nuclear Test-Ban treaty is known for banning all nuclear tests that where underwater, in the atmosphere, or in space. It was signed by the United States, Great Britian, and the Soviet Union (Now known as Russia).
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
                It began when the U.S dropped the two atomic bombs in efforts to make Imperial Japan surrender during World War II. It successfully drew World War II to an end.
	            10 years, after World War II a huge public concern started to form, people were worrying about the consequences of nuclear fallout that were caused by the testing of nuclear weapons on the surface of the Earth. So, negotiations were discussed between the U.S., The Soviet Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and France. The two countries temporarily halted testing until they started testing due to the Cold War tensions between U.S. and Soviet Union two years later. However, an agreement between the two countries would speed up as a result of the Cuban missile crisis. The crisis showed the dangers of nuclear confrontation.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">
                The two countries had finally drafted a treaty. And after 10 days of discussion in Moscow, three representatives of the three nuclear powers, United States; Dean Rusk, United Kingdom; Sir Douglas Home, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; A. Gromyko.
